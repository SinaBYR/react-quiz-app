## Description
This is a quiz app developed with React.js library. This project uses Typescript, Styled-components, Axios, and Chart.js. The quiz data is provided by Open Trivia Database API. Users can choose a category and challenge themselves to answer the questions, and finally get a brief summary of the test. The recap page shows how many questions they got it right and wrong or not answered at all, how much time it took them to finish the quiz, and correct answers to each question.
